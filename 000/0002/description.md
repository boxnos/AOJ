Digit Number
============

Write a program which computes the digit number of sum of two integers
*a* and *b*

Input
-----

There are several test cases. Each test case consists of two
non-negative integers *a* and *b* which are separeted by a space in a
line. The input terminates with EOF.

Constraints
-----------

-   0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000000
-   The number of datasets ≤ 200

Output
------

Print the number of digits of *a* + *b* for each data set.

Sample Input
------------

    5 7
    1 99
    1000 999

Output for the Sample Input
---------------------------

    2
    3
    4
