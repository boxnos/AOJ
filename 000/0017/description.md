Caesar Chipher
==============

In cryptography, Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely
known encryption method. Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher
in which each letter in the text is replaced by a letter some fixed
number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1,
'a' would be replaced by 'b', 'b' would become 'c', 'y' would become
'z', 'z' would become 'a', and so on. In that case, a text:

    this is a pen

is would become:

    uijt jt b qfo

Write a program which reads a text encrypted by Caesar Chipher and
prints the corresponding decoded text. The number of shift is secret and
it depends on datasets, but you can assume that the decoded text
includes any of the following words: "the", "this", or "that".

Input
-----

Input consists of several datasets. Each dataset consists of texts in a
line. Input ends with EOF. The text consists of lower-case letters,
periods, space, and end-of-lines. Only the letters have been encrypted.
A line consists of at most 80 characters.

Output
------

Print decoded texts in a line.

Sample Input
------------

    xlmw mw xli tmgxyvi xlex m xsso mr xli xvmt.

Output for the Sample Input
---------------------------
