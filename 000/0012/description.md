A Point in a Triangle
=====================

There is a triangle formed by three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)
on a plain.

Write a program which prints "YES" if a point P(xp, yp) is in the
triangle and "NO" if not.

You can suppose that P is never on the points nor sides of the triangle.

Input
-----

Input consists of several datasets. Each dataset consists of:

    x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 xp yp

All the input are real numbers. Input ends with EOF. The number of
datasets is less than or equal to 100.

You can assume that:

-   1.0 ≤ Length of each side of a tringle
-   0.001 ≤ Distance between P and each side of a triangle

Output
------

For each dataset, print "YES" or "NO" in a line.

Sample Input
------------

    0.0 0.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 2.0 1.5 0.5
    0.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 -1.0 3.0

Output for the Sample Input
---------------------------

    YES
    NO
