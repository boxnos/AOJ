Sum of 4 Integers
=================

Write a program which reads an integer *n* (n ≤ 50) and identifies the
number of combinations of *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d* (0 ≤ *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*
≤ 9) which meet the following equality:

            a + b + c + d = n

For example, for *n* = 35, we have 4 different combinations of (*a*,
*b*, *c*, *d*): (8, 9, 9, 9), (9, 8, 9, 9), (9, 9, 8, 9), (9, 9, 9, 8).

Input
-----

The input consists of several datasets. Each dataset consists of *n* in
a line.

Output
------

Print the number of combination in a line.

Sample Input
------------

    35
    1

Output for the Sample Input
---------------------------

    4
    4
