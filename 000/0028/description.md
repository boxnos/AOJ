Mode Value
==========

Your task is to write a program which reads a sequence of integers and
prints mode values of the sequence.

The mode value is the element which occurs most frequently. For example,
in the sample input, 3 and 5 respectively occur three times, 7 occurs
two times, and others occur only one. So, the mode values are 3 and 5.

Input
-----

A sequence of integers. The number of integers is less than or equals to
100.

Output
------

Print the mode values. If there are several mode values, print them in
ascending order.

Sample Input
------------

    5
    6
    3
    5
    8
    7
    5
    3
    9
    7
    3
    4

Output for the Sample Input
---------------------------

    3
    5
