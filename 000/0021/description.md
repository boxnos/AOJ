Parallelism
===========

There are four points: A(*x1*, *y1*), B(*x2*, *y2*), C(*x3*, *y3*), and
D(*x4*, *y4*). Write a program which determines whether the line AB and
the line CD are parallel. If those two lines are parallel, your program
should prints "YES" and if not prints "NO". You can assume that -100 ≤
*x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4* ≤ 100.

Input
-----

Input consists of several datasets. In the first line, you are given the
number of datasets *n*. There will be *n* lines where each line
correspondgs to each dataset. Each dataset consists of eight real
numbers:

    x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x4 y4

Each value is a real number with at most 6 digits after the decimal
point.

The number of datasets is less than or equal to 100.

Output
------

For each dataset, print "YES" or "NO" in a line.

Sample Input
------------

    2
    0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0
    3.0 2.0 9.0 6.0 13.0 5.0 7.0 9.0

Output for the Sample Input
---------------------------

    YES
    NO
