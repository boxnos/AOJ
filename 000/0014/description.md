Integral
========

Write a program which computes the area of a shape represented by the
following three lines:

It is clear that the area is 72000000, if you use an integral you learn
in high school. On the other hand, we can obtain an approximative area
of the shape by adding up areas of many rectangles in the shape as shown
in the following figure:

The approximative area *s* where the width of the rectangles is *d* is:

      area of rectangle where its width is d and height is f(d) + 
      area of rectangle where its width is d and height is f(2d) + 
      area of rectangle where its width is d and height is f(3d) + 
    ...
      area of rectangle where its width is d and height is f(600 - d)  

The more we decrease *d*, the higer-precision value which is close to
72000000 we could obtain. Your program should read the integer *d* which
is a divisor of 600, and print the area *s*.

Input
-----

The input consists of several datasets. Each dataset consists of an
integer *d* in a line.

Output
------

For each dataset, print the area *s* in a line.

Sample Input
------------

    20
    10

Output for the Sample Input
---------------------------

    68440000
    70210000
