Maximum Sum Sequence
====================

Given a sequence of numbers a~1~, a~2~, a~3~, , , a~*n*~, find the
maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of those numbers. Note that, a
subsequence of one element is also a *contiquous* subsequence.

Input
-----

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each data set consists of:

    n ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000)
    a1  ( -100000 ≤ ai ≤ 100000)
    a2  ( -100000 ≤ ai ≤ 100000)
    a3  ( -100000 ≤ ai ≤ 100000)
    .
    .
    an  ( -100000 ≤ ai ≤ 100000)

The input end with a line consisting of a single 0.

Output
------

For each dataset, print the maximum sum in a line.
