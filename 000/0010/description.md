Circumscribed Circle of A Triangle.
===================================

Write a program which prints the central coordinate (*px*, *py*) and the
radius *r* of a circumscribed circle of a triangle which is constructed
by three points (*x*1, *y*1)(*x*2, *y*2)(*x*3, *y*3) on the plane
surface.

Input
-----

Input consists of several datasets. In the first line, the number of
datasets *n* is given. Each dataset consists of:

    x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3

in a line. All the input are real numbers.

Output
------

For each dataset, print *px*, *py* and *r* separated by a space in a
line. Print the solution to three places of decimals. Round off the
solution to three decimal places.

Constraints
-----------

-   -100 ≤ *x*1, *y*1, *x*2, *y*2, *x*3, *y*3 ≤ 100
-   *n* ≤ 20

Sample Input
------------

    1
    0.0 0.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 2.0

Output for the Sample Input
---------------------------

    1.000 1.000 1.414
