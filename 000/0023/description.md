Circles Intersection
====================

You are given circle *A* with radius *r~a~* and with central coordinate
(*x~a~*, *y~a~*) and circle *B* with radius *r~b~* and with central
coordinate (*x~b~*, *y~b~*).

Write a program which prints:

-   "2" if *B* is in *A*,
-   "-2" if *A* is in *B*,
-   "1" if circumference of *A* and *B* intersect, and
-   "0" if *A* and *B* do not overlap.

You may assume that *A* and *B* are not identical.

Input
-----

The input consists of multiple datasets. The first line consists of an
integer *N*, the number of datasets. There will be *N* lines where each
line represents each dataset. Each data set consists of:

    xa ya ra xb yb rb

Output
------

For each dataset, print 2, -2, 1, or 0 in a line.
