Physical Experiments
====================

Ignoring the air resistance, velocity of a freely falling object *v*
after *t* seconds and its drop *y* in *t* seconds are represented by the
following formulas:

A person is trying to drop down a glass ball and check whether it will
crack. Your task is to write a program to help this experiment.

You are given the minimum velocity to crack the ball. Your program
should print the lowest possible floor of a building to crack the ball.
The height of the *N* floor of the building is given by 5 &times *N* -
5.

Input
-----

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset, a line, consists
of the minimum velocity to crack the ball. The input ends with EOF.

Output
------

For each dataset, print the lowest possible floor where the ball cracks.

Sample Input
------------

    25.4
    25.4

Output for the Sample Input
---------------------------

    8
